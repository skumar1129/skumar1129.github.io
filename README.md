## Breakdown of Sections

### 1. Home
A brief introduction of myself and my interests. Also includes my resume available for download.

A more in-depth look into my journey as a software engineering. Don't leave anything off the table and try to be an open book here.

### 4. Skills
A list of skills I have picked up during my time working professionally as well as through personal projects/learning and development.

Some sample personal projects of mine. They are broken down by 4 sections:
- Full-stack Projects: Projects that involve me coding FE/BE and sometimes even more to create an application.
- Data Engineering Projects: Projects that involve creating different types of data pipelines and other data engineering related work.
- Low level Coding Projects: Projects implemented in languages like C++ and Rust since that's a skill I try to refine and learn in my free time.
- Miscellaneous Projects: Projects that I have been prompted to complete that don't fit into a specific category but I found interesting.
