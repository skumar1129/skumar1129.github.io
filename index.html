        <h1>Hello, I'm Sahil Kumar</h1>
        <p>A software Engineer with a strong knowledge of developing solutions in the Cloud, Full-Stack Development, Data Engineering, and a well-versed understanding of many different system design architectures. I am certified in all three major cloud providers and have worked with a breadth of technology through professional work and personal projects. Lately I have been specializing in all types of work relating to big data including data architecture, data engineering, and backend engineering. Finally, I am always open to learning new programming languages, technologies, and types of software engineering.</p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I graduated from Ohio State in 2019 with a bachelors in Computer Science Engineering and a minor in Mathematics. 
            I started my career in Software Engineering Consulting at Captech Consulting, where I got to work on a variety of tech projects for different fortune 500 clients. 
            This work included some data analytics and mostly full-stack projects with cloud architecture involved. During this time of working in different software spaces, 
            I found myself mainly interested in all things data related and system design. 
            From there, I left for my next employer, Telesign, where I got to dive deeper in those interests by being a Software Engineer with responsibilites in implementing solutions in AWS 
            for data enginnering and backend projects. I enjoyed working for a tech company and playing a role where I got real ownership into the design, planning, and implementation of new and existing features. 
            Due to poor financials by the company, my entire team and I (as well as majority of US based engineers) were let go. Afterwards, I went back to Captech to get more experience with data engineering projects, 
            and had the pleasure of working a lot closer with data scientists on a machine learning project and taking lead on the design and implementation of the inference pipeline. However, I still hope to get back to a role where I can have greater ownership and work on products that excite me.
